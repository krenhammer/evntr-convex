_**Assistant**_

I'll help you enable the `@/components` alias in your TypeScript configuration. Let me first check your current `tsconfig.json` and then update it to include the path mapping.

---

```diff
      "isolatedModules": true,
      "jsx": "preserve",
-     "types": ["vite/client"]
+     "types": ["vite/client"],
+     "paths": {
+       "@/components/*": ["src/components/*"],
+       "@/*": ["src/*"]
+     }
    },
    "include": ["./src"]
```

---

Now I need to check if you're using Vite and update the Vite configuration to support the same alias resolution:

---

Read file: vite.config.ts

---

Now I'll update the Vite configuration to include the path alias resolution:

---

```diff
  import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
  import generouted from '@generouted/tanstack-react-router'
+ import path from 'path'
  
- export default defineConfig({ plugins: [react(), generouted()] })
+ export default defineConfig({ 
+   plugins: [react(), generouted()],
+   resolve: {
+     alias: {
+       '@/components': path.resolve(__dirname, './src/components'),
+       '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src')
+     }
+   }
+ })
  
```

---

Perfect! I've successfully enabled the `@/components` alias in your project. Here's what I've configured:

## Changes Made:

1. **Updated `tsconfig.json`**:
   - Added `paths` configuration to map `@/components/*` to `src/components/*`
   - Also added a general `@/*` mapping to `src/*` for broader alias support

2. **Updated `vite.config.ts`**:
   - Added `path` import for path resolution
   - Added `resolve.alias` configuration to support the same path mappings in Vite
   - This ensures both TypeScript and Vite understand the alias

## Usage:

Now you can use the alias in your imports like this:

```typescript
// Instead of relative imports like:
import MyComponent from '../../../components/MyComponent'

// You can now use:
import MyComponent from '@/components/MyComponent'

// Or for any file in src:
import { someUtil } from '@/utils/helpers'
```

The alias will work for both TypeScript intellisense and Vite's module resolution during development and build processes.
