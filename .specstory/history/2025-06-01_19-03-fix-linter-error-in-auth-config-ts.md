_**Assistant**_

I can see the linter error in the `convex/auth.config.ts` file. The issue is that `process` is not defined in this context. Let me first check the project structure and dependencies to understand the setup better.

---

Read file: package.json

---

Now let me check the tsconfig.json to see the TypeScript configuration:

---

Read file: tsconfig.json

---

Let me also check if there's a separate Convex configuration:

Let me check the Convex-specific tsconfig.json:

---

Read file: convex/tsconfig.json

---

Now let me check the auth.ts file to see how authentication is set up:

---

Read file: convex/auth.ts

---

Now I understand the issue. The `auth.config.ts` file is trying to use `process.env.CONVEX_SITE_URL`, but in the Convex environment, `process` is not available. Looking at the auth setup, it seems like this configuration might not be needed or should be configured differently.

Let me check the Convex documentation or examples to see the proper way to configure auth:

Based on my analysis, I can see that the `auth.config.ts` file is trying to use a configuration pattern that doesn't seem to be the standard way to configure Convex Auth. Looking at the `auth.ts` file, I can see that the authentication is already properly configured using the `convexAuth` function with `Password` and `Anonymous` providers.

The `auth.config.ts` file appears to be unnecessary or incorrectly configured. In Convex, environment variables are not accessed through `process.env` in the same way as Node.js applications. 

Let me check if there are any other auth configuration files or if this file is actually needed:
