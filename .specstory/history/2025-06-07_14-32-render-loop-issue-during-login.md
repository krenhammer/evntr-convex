render loop when logging in

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you investigate the render loop issue when logging in. Let me start by examining the authentication-related components and code to identify what might be causing the infinite render loop.

Now let me examine the router configuration and the main index page more closely, as I can see potential issues with the navigation logic:

---

Read file: src/pages/index.tsx

---

Read file: src/pages/auth/sign-in.tsx

---

Read file: src/auth/use-auth-hooks.convex.tsx

---

Now let me check the router configuration to understand how the routes are set up:

---

Read file: router.tsx

---

Let me also check if there are any route guards or authentication middleware:

---

            <summary>Searched codebase "routes.gen" • **1** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |

</details>

---

Read file: src/routes.gen.tsx

---

Now let me check the main app component to see if there are any authentication wrappers or providers:

---

Read file: src/pages/_app.tsx

---

Let me check if there's a main.tsx or index.tsx file that sets up the authentication provider:

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "main.tsx" • **5** results</summary>

| `undefined` |

</details>

---

Read file: src/main.tsx

---

Now I can see the issue! Let me analyze the problem:

## The Render Loop Issue

I've identified the cause of the render loop when logging in. Here's what's happening:

1. **Index page (`src/pages/index.tsx`)**: When a user visits the root `/`, this component runs a `useEffect` that checks authentication status and redirects:
   - If authenticated → redirects to `/app/events`
   - If not authenticated → redirects to `/auth/sign-in`

2. **Sign-in page (`src/pages/auth/sign-in.tsx`)**: Has a redirect check that immediately redirects authenticated users back to `/`:
   ```tsx
   if (isSignedIn) {
     navigate({ to: "/" });
     return null;
   }
   ```

3. **The Loop**: When a user successfully logs in:
   - They get redirected to `/` (from sign-in page)
   - Index page detects they're authenticated and redirects to `/app/events`
   - But there might be a timing issue where the authentication state isn't fully updated, causing it to redirect back to `/auth/sign-in`
   - Sign-in page sees they're authenticated and redirects back to `/`
   - This creates an infinite loop

Let me check the authentication hook to see if there are any timing issues:

| `file:///srv/store/Shared/Development/EventEnhancement/evntr-convex/src/pages/index.tsx` | L22 | `}, [isAuthenticated, isLoading, navigate]);` |

</details>

---

The issue is that the `useAuth` hook in the index page uses `isAuthenticated` and `isLoading`, but the sign-in page uses `isSignedIn`. Let me check if these are consistent:

---

Read file: src/auth/use-auth-hooks.convex.tsx

---

Now I can see the exact problem! The issue is inconsistent property names:

1. **`useAuth()` hook returns**: `isSignedIn`, `isLoaded` (but NOT `isAuthenticated` or `isLoading`)
2. **`useConvexAuth()` hook returns**: `isAuthenticated`, `isLoading` (but NOT `isSignedIn`)
3. **Index page uses**: `isAuthenticated`, `isLoading` from `useAuth()` - but `useAuth()` doesn't provide these!
4. **Sign-in page uses**: `isSignedIn` from `useAuth()` - which is correct

This means the index page is getting `undefined` for `isAuthenticated` and `isLoading`, causing the navigation logic to behave incorrectly.

Let me fix this by updating the index page to use the correct properties:

---

```diff
  
  export default function Home() {
-   const { isAuthenticated, isLoading } = useAuth();
+   const { isSignedIn, isLoaded } = useAuth();
    const navigate = useNavigate();
  
    useEffect(() => {
-     if (!isLoading) {
-       if (isAuthenticated) {
+     if (isLoaded) {
+       if (isSignedIn) {
          navigate({ to: "/app/events" });
        } else {
          navigate({ to: "/auth/sign-in" });
        }
      }
-   }, [isAuthenticated, isLoading, navigate]);
+   }, [isSignedIn, isLoaded, navigate]);
  
-   if (isLoading) {
+   if (!isLoaded) {
      return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }
```

---

Now let me also check if there are any other potential issues. Let me look at the sign-in page's redirect logic more carefully to ensure it's not causing additional problems:

---

Read file: src/pages/auth/sign-in.tsx

---

I notice another potential issue. The sign-in page has an immediate redirect check that runs on every render:

```tsx
// Redirect if already signed in
if (isSignedIn) {
  navigate({ to: "/" });
  return null;
}
```

This could cause issues because it's not wrapped in a `useEffect`, so it runs on every render. Let me fix this to prevent unnecessary navigation calls:

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you make the "/" page the pricing page. Let me first check if there's already a pricing page component, and then update the index page accordingly.

Great! There's already a pricing page. Let me examine it:

---

Read file: src/pages/pricing-page.tsx

---

Now I need to update the index page to use the pricing page content instead of the authentication redirect logic. I'll replace the current index page with the pricing page content:

Perfect! I've successfully transformed the "/" page into a pricing page. Here's what I've done:

## Changes Made:

1. **Replaced the authentication redirect logic** with a full pricing page layout
2. **Added a hero section** with compelling messaging about event management
3. **Included pricing plans** with three tiers (Basic, Pro, Enterprise) tailored for event management
4. **Added a header** with navigation that adapts based on authentication status
5. **Implemented smart routing logic**:
   - If user is signed in: "Get Started" buttons redirect to `/app/events`
   - If user is not signed in: "Get Started" buttons redirect to `/auth/sign-up`
   - Plan selection passes plan information to the sign-up page

## Key Features:

- **Responsive design** with a modern gradient background
- **Authentication-aware navigation** - shows different buttons based on login status
- **Professional pricing cards** with feature lists and clear CTAs
- **Event management focused** - customized the features to be relevant for event management
- **No more render loop** - removed the problematic redirect logic that was causing the infinite loop

The page now serves as a proper landing/pricing page for your event management platform while still providing appropriate navigation for both authenticated and unauthenticated users. The render loop issue is also resolved since we removed the automatic redirects that were causing the problem.
